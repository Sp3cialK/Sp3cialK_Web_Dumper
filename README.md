# Sp3cialK_Web_Dumper
This is a web dumper that is made to dump the whole files and folders of a web that has a traversal directory vulnerability.
So it's made to test if a normal user is able to access admin's zones in the web.
I don't take any responsibility for what you do with this program, this is made for pentesting your own website or a website in which you have permission to do this.


# How to use it
It's pretty intuitive, just execute it and a menu will be displayed. In the two options of the menu, helpful information will be displayed.


# Source code
The name of the variables is in Spanish. I'm sorry, but im not transalating everything now. But in a future it will be translated.
In fact, i will make a version with the text and the variables in English, and other version in Spanish.


# Next updates
-The program will be able to dump the directory using a proxy.
-The program is made to use it in Linux. If you use it in Windows you may get some errors. This will be fixed in a future.


# Bugs
If you find a bug, please report it. It will help me and you a lot :)
